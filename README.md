# Shallow-Neural-Networks
Neural Networks with one and two hidden layers using tensorflow framework.

There are two files here:
1) Neural Network with one hidden layer
2) Neural Network with two hidden layers

Tensor flow frame work is used here. If you have doubts related to the code, please raise an issue. Doubts related to tensor flow code can be directed to its github repository here: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow




Highly inspired from Andrew NG's Coursera Deep Learning Course.
